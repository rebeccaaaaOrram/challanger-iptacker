# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker solution

This is my solution for the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). Frontend Mentor provides challenges to practice with real projects.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build an IP address tracker application that allows users to enter a domain name or IP address and get information about that location, such as country and city.

## My Development Process

### Built With

The solution was built using the following technologies:

- React.js

- Leaflet.js (for displaying the map)

- HTML

- CSS

### What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to integrate Leaflet.js with React to display a map and add markers. I also gained experience in fetching data from an API and updating the UI based on the response.

### Continued Development

For future improvements, I would like to enhance the UI design and add additional functionality, such as displaying more detailed information about the location and providing suggestions for similar IP addresses or domains.
